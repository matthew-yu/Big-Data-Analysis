# Big-Data-Analysis
Here are assignments I have done during my Big Data Analysis course, 2017 Spring\
The course was taught by Prof. Jin Yuan Wang from NCTU TLM\
\
This was a relatively Introductory course, but the effort the instructor put in was marvellous, perhaps one of the most hardworking professor I've ever met.\
\
Though the instructor made all his materials himself, he did recommend a textbook to start from scratch:
>Data Science for Business by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett
>
\
All of the files comes with questions and answers, but unfortunately some of the questions needed context from the course materials, which I don't think is appropriate to put out here publically. Same goes for some more sophisticated projects within the course, for it uses some datasets that I think is best kept confidential.
